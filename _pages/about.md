>        Nothing changes when heart holds still.<br>All is well as you are well.

My name is PeiXiaoting, you can call me tinger. I am now a student in Department of Information Management at XJTU.

My name is dusmart. Now I am a student in Department of Computter science at SJTU. Here is my story.

When I was young, I always went to game room. Not only did the games attract me, but also the machine itself attract me so much. How could the screen play so beautiful cartoon characters? How could the headphone play so nice background music? How does the machine work? A smart friend told me that they can work because you control them through your gamepad. "You push the UP button. Then, the screen plays the character jumps. You let the person beat mine. Then, it plays the sound." He added.

Later, I went to middle school. My mom brought a personal computer home. It was the first time I got in touch with a computer. I can still remember the white-color words on the black screen, the starting up music with the colorful desktop and the subtle icon of WindowsXP. "How does it work?" I asked. Unlike other questions my sister didn't answer, she told me that the answer is complicated and I can't understand.I didn't get the answer, but I know it is definite. 

"So, you want to understand the computer?" A net friend asked.<br>
"Of course!" <br>
"I bet you will be close to the answer when you can program!" He said when he gave me a list of websites for self-learning. Failing to resist the mystery of computer, I started learning a programming language called JAVA when almost everyone was preparing for the College Entrance Examination. After I programmed my first few programs, I learned computer take instructions in this way to control other components.

In the same year, I got the letter of admission from SJTU. Without any doubt, I choose the computer science as my major course. Now I still don't know exactly how does the computer works and I know there is much more to learn. I believe I will get closer and closer to the answer.
