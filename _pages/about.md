My name is PeiXiaoting(裴肖婷), you can call me **tinger**. I am now a student in Department of Information Management at XATU.

My name is DuShuai(杜帅).You can call me **dusmart**. Now I am a student in Department of Computer science at SJTU. Here is my story.

When I was young, I always went to game room. Not only did the games attract me, but also the machine itself attracted me so much. How could the screen display so beautiful cartoon characters? How does the machine work? **I knew nothing.**

Later, I went to middle school. My mom brought a personal computer home. It was the first time I got in touch with a computer. It's just like I suddenly fall in love with **tinger** at the first sight. I can still remember the white-color words on the black screen, the starting up music with the colorful desktop and the subtle icon of Windows XP. "How does it work?" I asked. My elder sister told me something about 0s and 1s. But the answer is so complicated that I can't understand then. **I didn't get the answer, but I know it is definite.**

"So, you want to understand the computer?" A net friend asked. "Of course!" "Then, I bet you will find the answer when you can program!" He said when he gave me a list of websites for self-learning. Failing to resist the mystery of computer, I started learning a programming language called JAVA. After I had done my first few programs, **I learned computer can take program instructions to control other components.**

In the same year, I got the letter of admission from SJTU. Without any doubt, I choose the Computer Science as my major. Now I still don't know exactly how does the computer work. **But I believe I will get closer and closer to the answer finally.**
