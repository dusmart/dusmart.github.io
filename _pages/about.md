My name is PeiXiaoting(裴肖婷), you can call me **tinger**. I am now a student in Department of Information Management at XJTU.

My name is DuShuai(杜帅).You can call me **dusmart**. Now I am a student in Department of Computter science at SJTU. Here is my story.

1. When I was young, I always went to game room. Not only did the games attract me, but also the machine itself attracted me so much. How could the screen display so beautiful cartoon characters? How does the machine work? I know nothing.

2. Later, I went to middle school. My mom brought a personal computer home. It was the first time I got in touch with a computer. I can still remember the white-color words on the black screen, the starting up music with the colorful desktop and the subtle icon of Windows XP. It's just like you suddenly fall in love with some girl at the first sight. "How does it work?" I asked. Unlike other questions my elder sister didn't answer, she told me something about 0 and 1. But the answer is so complicated that I can't understand then. I didn't get the answer, but I know it is definite.

3. "So, you want to understand the computer?" A net friend asked. "Of course!" "Then, I bet you will find the answer when you can program!" He said when he gave me a list of websites for self-learning. Failing to resist the mystery of computer, I started learning a programming language called JAVA when almost everyone else was preparing for the College Entrance Examination. After I programmed my first few programs, I learned computer take instructions to control other components in that way .

4. In the same year, I got the letter of admission from SJTU. Without any doubt, I choose the computer science as my major. Now I still don't know exactly how does the computer work and I know there is much more to learn. But I believe I will get closer and closer to the answer fianlly.
